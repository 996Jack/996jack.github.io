<h1>Telstra Payphones are now Free!</h1>
<h2>f you need to make a phone call, but you're short on some coin, well fear not because payphones are now free! Telstra, who operates all payphones across the country made the announcement today, saying they want to give every Aussie the chance to be able to stay in touch, especially in difficult situations. Yep, as of today, Telstra's network of more than 15,000 payphones will be free to use for all Australians. As long as the calls aren't overseas, and they last less than 6 hours. While they might seem like relics of the past, Telstra said more than 11 million calls were made last year. Including 230,000 to services like triple 0 and lifeline. Australia's first public telephone opened in the Sydney Post office in 1893, a hundred years later in the 1990s, there were more than 80,000 scattered across the country. But now their numbers have dwindled because people just use their mobiles. Telstra says having free access to a phone call is really important for people in life-threatening situations, contacting loved ones after things like bushfires, or just phoning a friend when you're lonely. So if like me, you've never been to a phone booth, well maybe today is the day to change that</h2>
